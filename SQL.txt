1. SQL Basics

    SQL Syntax: Basic structure of an SQL query.
    SQL Commands: Understanding of DDL (Data Definition Language), DML (Data Manipulation Language), and DCL (Data Control Language) commands.
        DDL: CREATE, ALTER, DROP, TRUNCATE, RENAME
        DML: SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE
        DCL: GRANT, REVOKE
    Database and Tables: Basic concepts of databases and tables, how to create and delete them.

2. SELECT Statement

    Basic SELECT Query: Retrieving data using the SELECT statement.
        Example: SELECT column1, column2 FROM table_name;
    DISTINCT: Removing duplicate records with DISTINCT.
        Example: SELECT DISTINCT column_name FROM table_name;
    WHERE Clause: Filtering records based on conditions.
        Example: SELECT column1 FROM table_name WHERE condition;
    AND, OR, NOT Operators: Combining multiple conditions using logical operators.
        Example: SELECT column_name FROM table_name WHERE condition1 AND condition2;
    BETWEEN, IN, LIKE: Using BETWEEN for range queries, IN for multiple values, and LIKE for pattern matching.
        Example: SELECT * FROM table_name WHERE column_name LIKE 'A%';

3. Sorting and Limiting Data

    ORDER BY Clause: Sorting query results by one or more columns (ascending or descending).
        Example: SELECT * FROM table_name ORDER BY column_name ASC;
    LIMIT / OFFSET: Limiting the number of rows returned (specific to databases like MySQL, PostgreSQL, etc.).
        Example: SELECT * FROM table_name LIMIT 10;

4. Aggregate Functions

    COUNT(): Counting the number of rows.
    SUM(): Summing the values in a numeric column.
    AVG(): Calculating the average value of a numeric column.
    MIN() and MAX(): Finding the minimum and maximum values.
        Example: SELECT COUNT(*) FROM table_name WHERE condition;
    GROUP BY Clause: Grouping rows based on one or more columns.
        Example: SELECT column_name, COUNT(*) FROM table_name GROUP BY column_name;
    HAVING Clause: Filtering groups created by GROUP BY.
        Example: SELECT column_name, COUNT(*) FROM table_name GROUP BY column_name HAVING COUNT(*) > 5;

5. Joining Tables

    INNER JOIN: Retrieves rows that have matching values in both tables.
        Example: SELECT * FROM table1 INNER JOIN table2 ON table1.column = table2.column;
    LEFT JOIN (LEFT OUTER JOIN): Retrieves all rows from the left table and matching rows from the right table.
        Example: SELECT * FROM table1 LEFT JOIN table2 ON table1.column = table2.column;
    RIGHT JOIN (RIGHT OUTER JOIN): Retrieves all rows from the right table and matching rows from the left table.
        Example: SELECT * FROM table1 RIGHT JOIN table2 ON table1.column = table2.column;
    FULL JOIN (FULL OUTER JOIN): Retrieves rows with matching values in either the left or right table.
        Example: SELECT * FROM table1 FULL JOIN table2 ON table1.column = table2.column;
    SELF JOIN: Joining a table with itself.
        Example: SELECT a.column1, b.column2 FROM table a, table b WHERE a.id = b.id;

6. Subqueries

    Subquery in SELECT: Using subqueries to return data for the main query.
        Example: SELECT column1 FROM table1 WHERE column2 IN (SELECT column2 FROM table2);
    Subquery in WHERE Clause: Filtering results based on subquery results.
    Correlated Subquery: A subquery that refers to the outer query.
        Example: SELECT column1 FROM table1 WHERE column2 = (SELECT MAX(column2) FROM table2 WHERE table1.id = table2.id);

7. Data Manipulation

    INSERT INTO: Inserting new data into a table.
        Example: INSERT INTO table_name (column1, column2) VALUES (value1, value2);
    UPDATE: Modifying existing records in a table.
        Example: UPDATE table_name SET column1 = value1 WHERE condition;
    DELETE: Deleting records from a table.
        Example: DELETE FROM table_name WHERE condition;

8. SQL Constraints

    PRIMARY KEY: Ensuring uniqueness for a column and preventing NULL values.
    FOREIGN KEY: Ensuring referential integrity between two tables.
    UNIQUE: Ensuring all values in a column are distinct.
    CHECK: Enforcing a condition on values in a column.
    NOT NULL: Ensuring a column cannot have NULL values.
    DEFAULT: Assigning a default value to a column when no value is specified.

9. Data Types in SQL

    Numeric Types: INT, FLOAT, DECIMAL, BIGINT.
    Character Types: CHAR, VARCHAR, TEXT.
    Date and Time: DATE, TIME, DATETIME, TIMESTAMP, YEAR.
    Boolean: BOOLEAN.
    Binary Types: BLOB, BINARY, VARBINARY.

10. Normalization and Denormalization

    Normalization: Process of organizing data to reduce redundancy (1NF, 2NF, 3NF).
    Denormalization: Adding redundancy to optimize performance in some cases.
    Functional Dependency: Understanding dependencies between columns.

11. Indexes in SQL

    Creating Indexes: Improving query performance using indexes.
        Example: CREATE INDEX index_name ON table_name (column_name);
    Types of Indexes: Single-column index, composite index, unique index.
    Index Usage: When to use indexes and their impact on performance.

12. Views and Stored Procedures

    Views: Creating virtual tables from queries, and using CREATE VIEW.
        Example: CREATE VIEW view_name AS SELECT column1, column2 FROM table_name;
    Stored Procedures: Creating and executing stored procedures for reusable SQL code.
        Example: CREATE PROCEDURE procedure_name AS BEGIN ... END;
    Triggers: Using triggers to automatically perform actions on certain events (INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE).

13. Transactions in SQL

    Transaction Control: Understanding BEGIN, COMMIT, ROLLBACK, and SAVEPOINT.
    ACID Properties: Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability in transactions.
    Isolation Levels: Understanding isolation levels like READ COMMITTED, READ UNCOMMITTED, SERIALIZABLE.

14. SQL Optimization

    Query Optimization: Using proper indexing, avoiding SELECT *, and analyzing query plans.
    Explain Plan: Using EXPLAIN to analyze and optimize SQL queries.

15. SQL Joins and Set Operations (Advanced)

    Union and Union All: Combining results of multiple queries.
        Example: SELECT column1 FROM table1 UNION SELECT column1 FROM table2;
    INTERSECT: Retrieving common rows between two queries.
        Example: SELECT column1 FROM table1 INTERSECT SELECT column1 FROM table2;
    EXCEPT: Retrieving rows from the first query that are not in the second query.

16. Advanced SQL Concepts (Optional for Freshers)

    Recursive Queries: Using WITH clause for recursive queries (common table expressions - CTE).
    Window Functions: Using functions like ROW_NUMBER(), RANK(), LEAD(), and LAG() to perform calculations over a window of rows.
    Pivot Tables: Using CASE or GROUP BY to create pivot tables in SQL.
